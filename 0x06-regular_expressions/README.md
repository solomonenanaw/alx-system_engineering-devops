Regular expression

In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. I practiced building them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

Tasks

Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line.

0. Simply matching School

0-simply_match_school.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression School.

1. Repetition Token #0

1-repetition_token_0.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with between 2-5 t's in between hb and n.
