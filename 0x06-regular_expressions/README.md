Regular expression

In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. I practiced building them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

Tasks

Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line.

0. Simply matching School

0-simply_match_school.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression School.

1. Repetition Token #0

1-repetition_token_0.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with between 2-5 t's in between hb and n.

2. Repetition Token #1

2-repetition_token_1.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hn with 0 or 1 occurrences of b and 0 or 1 occurrences of t in between h and n.

3. Repetition Token #2

3-repetition_token_2.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with 1 or more t's in between hb and n.

4. Repetition Token #3

4-repetition_token_3.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with 0 or more t's in between hb and n.

5. Not quite HBTN yet

5-beginning_and_end.rb: Ruby script that matches a regular expression starting with h and ending with n with any single character in between.
